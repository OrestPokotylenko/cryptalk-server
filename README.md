# Cryptalk Server

Cryptalk Server is a self-hosted message relay for the Cryptalk communication system.  
It securely stores and delivers encrypted messages between trusted devices connected to the same server.

It is intended to run on a personal Linux server and requires no cloud services.

## Overview

Cryptalk Server is a lightweight backend service designed for users who want to communicate securely over the internet using their Cryptalk devices.  
All messages are encrypted end-to-end before reaching the server. The server does not perform any decryption or metadata processing.

## Pairing

Devices connect to the server only after being securely paired, either:
 
- over the internet using server address

Pairing is done once. The server itself only facilitates encrypted message delivery.

## Features

- Storage of encrypted messages
- PostgreSQL database
- Minimal and auditable codebase
- Docker deployment
- No personal data collection or tracking

## Setup

The server is distributed as a prebuilt Docker image.  
Installation instructions will be provided on the official Cryptalk website.

## Security

- API access requires a secure key per device
- Messages are never decrypted
